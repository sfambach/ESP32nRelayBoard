Test programm for relay boards with an ESP32 from the quick Ali ;)

Be careful, the programming connector has an 5V input but I think the TX/RX lines are only 3 Volt. 
So start with 3 Volt for the transmission lines.
Document the defines ONE_RELAY ... EIGHT_RELAY to select which board you have.
Check the gpios if they are sufficent for your board. 
Most times they are missing in the description of the seller but you can take a look at the boad itself, there normally you can see where the pins of the relays are connected to.
